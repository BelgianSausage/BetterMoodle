      <p>
        If you work with React or React Native, feel that your coding speed is slow, 
        spend your time catching bugs, and not adding new features, work with long 
        source files and have a hard time finding stuff, and implement the same logic 
        over and over again, you will double your coding speed if you refactor your 
        code into reusable building blocks.
